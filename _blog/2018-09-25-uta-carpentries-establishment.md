In 2018 [The University of Texas, Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/uta/) pledged to become a [Silver Member Organization](https://carpentries.org/members/) of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). This commitment resulted from a campaign by Anna Williford and Daren Card on behalf of the existing Software Carpentry teaching group at UTA. The Silver Membership is sponsored by [UTA Libraries](https://library.uta.edu/), [College of Science](https://www.uta.edu/science/) and [College of Engineering](https://www.uta.edu/engineering/).

Given this commitment by UTA, the existing Software Carpentry teaching group is rebranding itself as [**UTA Carpentries**](https://carpentries.uta.edu), with a mission to teach a broad array of coding and data science skills to researchers and students at UTA and the broader Dallas-Fort Worth region. UTA Carpentries has established [carpentries.uta.edu](https://carpentries.uta.edu) to organize and announce future group workshops and activities.

Please watch this website and our complementary social media and email lists for announcements about future workshops and other initiatives.
