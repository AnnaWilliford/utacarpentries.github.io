[The University of Texas, Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/uta/) recently pledged to become a [Silver Member Organization](https://carpentries.org/members/) of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). This commitment resulted from a campaign by Anya Williford and Daren Card on behalf of the existing Software Carpentry teaching group at UTA. This group has received generous support from the [UTA Library](https://library.uta.edu/) over the past several years and this broader pledge by UTA extends this support well into the future.

Given this commitment by UTA, the existing Software Carpentry teaching group is rebranding itself as [**UTA Carpentries**](https://carpentries.uta.edu), with a mission to teach a broad array of coding and data science skills to researchers and students at UTA and the broader Dallas-Fort Worth region. UTA Carpentries has established [carpentries.uta.edu](https://carpentries.uta.edu) to organize and announce future group workshops and activities.

Please watch this website and our complementary social media and email lists for announcements about future workshops and other initiatives.
